6/2/2025,6/4/2025,"Old building and there was a smell of damp especially around the bathroom. The place is very close to the train line and it is very noisy with all the bars and restaurants nearby. The lift was not working so hard to get up and down with all bags and kids at once. We asked for an extra pillow which we never received but the worst thing was the Internet. Very slow with individual login set up for each device (even the TV in the apartment needed a separate login). As we arrived late and had to self checkin we only got 3 logins left at the table, however we are 4 people with more than one device per person, which meant that some of us had to use their mobile data instead.",67515,8.303023338,6.901803017,7.57955122,7.466187477,7.520712852,8.692822456,7.653725147,cd6d90ef2c6698eb,The apartment was very spacious and had large windows and 2 balconies.
