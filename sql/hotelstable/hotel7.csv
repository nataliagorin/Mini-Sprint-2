5/9/2025,5/14/2025,"Unfortunately there was a bit of early noise at the theatre on a couple of the mornings because of equipment changes at the theatre. Nothing too bad though.
The balcony door came off its hinges, meaning we couldn't go on to the balcony and couldn't be fixed. Once they had been informed, the Juno staff team sent someone to check it, and apologised as it wouldn't be able to be fixed while we were staying there. The lighting in the bedrooms was strange - no good for reading. Would have liked mirrors in the bedrooms.",12410895,9.316004753,9.282899857,9.422502518,9.534000397,8.973041534,9.6666666,9.665504456,7c49fd23cf0bc264,"The location was very good.
