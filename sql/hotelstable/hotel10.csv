5/11/2025,5/14/2025,"Very Disappointing Stay – Poor Service and No Accountability

Stayed on the 4th floor and had a very unpleasant experience. There was no shower gel or soap in the bathroom—just shampoo and conditioner. When I asked reception, I was told “people in Denmark don’t use shower gel,” which felt dismissive and unhelpful.

The next morning at 7:30 AM, we were woken by loud drilling noises right near our room. When we reported it, staff gave inconsistent answers—first claiming they didn’t know, then later saying it might be from construction on the 5th floor (which supposedly starts at 11). They denied responsibility and offered no compensation.

Between the lack of basic amenities and the staff’s unwillingness to take accountability, this hotel was a big disappointment. Would not stay here again.",8717042,8.704391479,7.193652153,7.878851891,7.757662773,7.596534729,9.415916443,7.605091095,97a62caa7b1bc7df,,3,2,en,Not qualified to be a hotel,871704214,Couple,United Kingdom,Chun
