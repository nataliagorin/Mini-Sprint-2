6/2/2025,6/6/2025,Mattresses very hard. No towels for pool. Noisy some nights as walls very thin. Some non clean communal areas especially lifts.,10856230,8.174266815,8.022724152,7.931892872,7.882017136,8.077920914,8.810523033,8.558345795,8bde802b1da61bd5,"Room was clean but some communal areas not so much, the cleaners came to room every day but only collected towels and quick mopped floors, no bed change or wiping surfaces. 

Excellent lifeguards, really kept an eye on the pool for safety but also for everyone’s enjoyment. 

Value for money was good because of buffet from 8-13:30pm, I probably wouldn't agree if that wasn't included. Location was excellent, all staff were nice.",4,8,en,Would stay again,1085623003,Family,United Kingdom,Louise

5/24/2025,5/28/2025,"Not the cleanest rooms. Not enough staff in the restaurant to clean the tables and the area around the buffet, which is too dirty... always had to check the cleanliness of the plates and glasses, as they were too often dirty. The cleanliness of the pool is also not of the highest standard. Unfortunately, the possibility of eating around the pool causes the wind and seagulls to blow parts of the leftover brunch into the pool. In the evening, when many people take showers, there is a shortage of hot water",10856230,8.174266815,8.022724152,7.931892872,7.882017136,8.077920914,8.810523033,8.558345795,24ceb28a1f9669d3,"Excellent location on the city's main street.
