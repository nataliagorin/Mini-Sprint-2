Their listing stated check-in was available from 00:00 to 00:00, which is why I specifically chose this place, as I was arriving early in the morning after a 2-day flight. However, when I arrived and called them, they told me check-in was only available after noon.

As a result, I was left stranded on the street, exhausted after my long journey. I contacted them to request a refund, but no one has responded or returned my money.
