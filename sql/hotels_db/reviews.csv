We tried calling the reception for help but they never answered our call. I ended up taking an Uber to a hospital the next day, which cost me quite some money. When I asked for a form to document the incident, they said their policy was that they were not responsible for anything that happened within the room. I had to spend most of my holiday in the room because my ankle was very badly sprained and painful. Most of the staff were not very friendly. The breakfast was plentiful and varied but not very tasty. The hotel itself was extraordinarily plain.

And everything was great! Everything, the staff, the room, the cleanliness, the excellent breakfast, the location - everything suited us absolutely.
Any request or question to the service staff did not go unnoticed. Whether it was a question of where to eat deliciously, or how best to get somewhere, or what time is best to visit this or that attraction.
For example, at the reception, we were advised to definitely visit the farmers' market, which is only open on Saturdays - thanks for the advice!
Without any problems or extra charges, we were provided with an early check-in and late check-out! Thank you for that too.
I would like to add that the first room provided seemed a bit cramped to us and we asked to show us an alternative option if possible. As a result, we received a spacious room for 4 people, consisting of two rooms with two double beds! The room was on the attic floor, but we liked it and preferred to stay in it. And, of course, again without extra charge!
Bed linen is changed every 3 days.
There is no air conditioning in the rooms, but in May it didn't bother us.
If you are a light sleeper, you can ask for a room on the upper floors and with windows not facing the bar in the neighboring building.
But in general, the hotel is in a great location, on a small side street, 6-7 minutes walk from the main Old Town Square with the astronomical clock.
3-4 minutes walk from a small shopping center and a Billa supermarket. By the way, Freud's head is also there.

5/11/2025,5/14/2025,"Very Disappointing Stay – Poor Service and No Accountability

Stayed on the 4th floor and had a very unpleasant experience. There was no shower gel or soap in the bathroom—just shampoo and conditioner. When I asked reception, I was told “people in Denmark don’t use shower gel,” which felt dismissive and unhelpful.

The next morning at 7:30 AM, we were woken by loud drilling noises right near our room. When we reported it, staff gave inconsistent answers—first claiming they didn’t know, then later saying it might be from construction on the 5th floor (which supposedly starts at 11). They denied responsibility and offered no compensation.
